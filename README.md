### Capturing Delayed Feedback in Conversion Rate Prediction via Elapsed-Time Sampling

This is the code and model checkpoints to reproduce the results on the public dataset.

The criteo dataset is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x4KktfZtls9QjNdFYKCjTpfjM4tG2PcK/view?usp=sharing

For detailed information, please refer to the comments.

Please run 
```
python main.py --help
```
to see all the arguments.

I uploaded a run.sh file as a reference to run the code, however, the pathes should be modified accordingly.
